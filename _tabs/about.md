My name is Elizabeth Boswell, I'm a PhD student in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. I'm interested in large-scale Internet measurements, especially involving the DNS and network address translation. This is my technology and research-focused blog, where I write about things I come across that I find interesting or useful and want to share.
