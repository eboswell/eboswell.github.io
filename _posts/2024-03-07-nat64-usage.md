Our [RIPE Labs blog post](https://labs.ripe.net/author/elizabeth-boswell/measuring-nat64-usage-in-the-wild/) is now live! It is based on work done for my [MSci dissertation]({{site.url}}/assets/pdf/thesis-msci-boswell.pdf) last year, an expanded and revised version of which is now on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14632).
